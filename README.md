# Interactive Calculator Project ðŸ“Œ

This project involves creating an interactive calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator will allow users to perform basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Technologies Used :computer:

- HTML5: Used to create the structure of the calculator.
- CSS3: Used to style and design the calculator.
- JavaScript: Used to implement the calculation logic and user interaction.

## Versiones :speech_balloon:

This project uses the following versions of the main technologies:

- React: 16.8.0
- HTML: HTML5
- CSS: CSS3
- JavaScript: ECMAScript 6

## Features :floppy_disk:

The calculator will have the following features:

- Numeric buttons from 0 to 9 for entering numbers.
- Mathematical operation buttons like addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
- An equals (=) button to calculate the result.
- A clear (C) button to clear the current input.
- A display screen to show both input and the result of the operation.
- Handling of multiple operations and consecutive operations.

## Design and Style :memo:

 * The calculator will be designed with an intuitive and attractive user interface using CSS to format the elements. Appropriate colors and layouts will be used to enhance the user experience.

## Implementation :mortar_board:

 * The calculation logic will be implemented using JavaScript. Click events will be used to capture user actions and perform necessary calculations. The results will be displayed on the calculator's screen.

# Guide to Deploy an Interactive Calculator in React

 * This guide will show you how to deploy an interactive calculator already created in React on your local server.

## Step 1: Download the Source Code

 1. Make sure you have downloaded the React calculator source code from the repository or source where you have it stored.

 2. Place the code in a folder of your choice on your system.

## Step 2: Install Dependencies

 1. Open your terminal and navigate to the folder where you have the calculator code.

 2. Run the following command to install React dependencies:

#Copy code
```
npm install
```

# Create a React Project with `create-react-app`

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to create a new React project using `create-react-app`, a tool that makes it easy to initially set up a React app.

## Step 3: Install `create-react-app`

 * If you don't already have `create-react-app` installed globally on your system, you can do so by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install -g create-react-app
```

## Step 4: Create a New Project

  * Once create-react-app is installed, you can create a new React project with the following command. Replace app-interactive-calculator with whatever name you want for your project:

#Copy code
```
npx create-react-app app-interactive-calculator
```

## Step 5: Start the Application

 * Once the dependencies have been installed successfully, run the following command to start the React application:


#Copy code

```
npm start
```

 * This will start a development server and open your interactive calculator in your default web browser.

## Step 6: Access the Calculator

 * Open your web browser (preferably Google Chrome, Firefox or Edge).

 * In the address bar, enter the following URL:

#Copy code

```
http://localhost:3000
```

## Ready!
Now your interactive calculator in React is deployed and ready to be used on your local server!

Remember that these steps assume that you already have Node.js and npm installed on your system and that you have downloaded the calculator source code in React. Be sure to adjust the details according to your specific needs.
