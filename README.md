# Interactive Calculator Project ðŸ“Œ

This project involves creating an interactive calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator will allow users to perform basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Technologies Used :computer:

- HTML5: Used to create the structure of the calculator.
- CSS3: Used to style and design the calculator.
- JavaScript: Used to implement the calculation logic and user interaction.

## Features :floppy_disk:

The calculator will have the following features:

- Numeric buttons from 0 to 9 for entering numbers.
- Mathematical operation buttons like addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
- An equals (=) button to calculate the result.
- A clear (C) button to clear the current input.
- A display screen to show both input and the result of the operation.
- Handling of multiple operations and consecutive operations.

## Design and Style :memo:

The calculator will be designed with an intuitive and attractive user interface using CSS to format the elements. Appropriate colors and layouts will be used to enhance the user experience.

## Implementation :mortar_board:

The calculation logic will be implemented using JavaScript. Click events will be used to capture user actions and perform necessary calculations. The results will be displayed on the calculator's screen.

```html
<!-- Example of the HTML structure of the calculator -->
<div class="calculator">
  <div class="screen">
    <!-- Screen to display input and result -->
  </div>
  <div class="buttons">
    <!-- Numeric and operation buttons -->
  </div>
</div>
